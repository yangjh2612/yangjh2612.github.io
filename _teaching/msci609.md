**Course description**: Quantitative Data Analysis for Management Sciences covers the statistical models needed to understand modern empirical research in Management Sciences for graduate students. The main objective of the course is to give students the foundation for understanding and actively engaging with statistical problems from a wide range of methodological perspectives. For this purpose, the course introduces various statistical approaches, including those used in modern machine learning, and prepares students for upper-level courses specialized in the application of each approach. While the course provides a useful comparison of competing methods, equal emphasis is given to the understanding of foundational concepts in statistics with a special focus on linear regression. The course aims for an intuitive understanding of quantitative methods based on examples and the actual implementation of methods using statistical programming, and therefore the use of matrix algebra is limited unless necessary.
