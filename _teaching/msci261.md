**Course description**: Engineering Economics: Financial Management for Engineers covers basic economic and financial concepts widely used in financial decision making. The main objective of the course is to give engineering students the foundation for understanding the basic building blocks of modern financial management. For this purpose, the course will discuss key concepts and topics in engineering economics and corporate finance, such as valuation, project evaluation, elements of financial statements, stock and bond market, and risk analysis/management. While the course is ambitious in terms of the coverage, equal attention is paid to the real-life examples to show how each concept can help us to understand the mechanism of firms' behavior in the modern corporate system. Since the course aims for an intuitive and basic understanding of corporate finance based on examples, the use of mathematics is limited and only a high-school level of algebra is required.
