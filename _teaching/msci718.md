**Course description**: The objective of this course is to develop skills with a range of procedures and programs for multivariate data analysis. The focus will be on practical issues such as selecting the appropriate analysis, preparing data for analysis, menu-driven and syntax programming, interpreting output, and presenting results of a complex nature. The course aims for an intuitive understanding of quantitative methods based on examples and the actual implementation of methods using statistical programming, and therefore the use of matrix algebra is limited unless necessary. Prerequisites are  introductory statistics courses such as MSCI 609.
