I am an Assistant Professor of [Management Science and Engineering](https://uwaterloo.ca/management-science-engineering/) in the Faculty of Engineering at the University of Waterloo. I am also a Research Associate at the [Institute for New Economic Thinking](https://www.inet.ox.ac.uk) at the University of Oxford and an affiliated member of the [Waterloo Data and Artificial Intelligence Institute](https://uwaterloo.ca/artificial-intelligence-institute/) and the [Waterloo Institute for Complexity and Innovation](https://uwaterloo.ca/complexity-innovation/).

Before joining Waterloo, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Oxford, working with [Doyne J. Farmer](https://www.doynefarmer.com/). I earned a PhD in Economics from the New School for Social Research under the supervision of (Duncan Foley)[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duncan_K._Foley] and hold a BS in Western History from Seoul National University.

My research explores models of technological change, productivity distribution, and firm growth & innovation by applying methods from information theory, Bayesian multilevel modeling, and distributional analysis, with a particular emphasis on power-law patterns in economic data.
