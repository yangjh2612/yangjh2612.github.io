I am an Assistant Professor of Management Sciences, Faculty of Engineering at theÂ  University of Waterloo. 

I am an applied economist with strong interests in interdisciplinary work. My research has focused on information-theoretic approaches in economics, power-law behaviour in economic data, and Bayesian multilevel modelling. I have published in economics and multidisciplinary science journals such as [Journal of Evolutionary Economics](https://www.springer.com/journal/191), [International Review of Financial Analysis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/international-review-of-financial-analysis), [Metroeconomica](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/1467999x), [Journal of Economic Surveys](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/14676419), [Economics Systems Research](https://www.tandfonline.com/toc/cesr20/current), [Entropy](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy), [European Physical Journals Special Topics](https://www.springer.com/journal/11734), and [Advances in Complex Systems](https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscinet/acs).
